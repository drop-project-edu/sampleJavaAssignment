### Instructions

- Create a Java project in your IDE with the structure depicted at the end of this page.
- Within your `Main` class, implement a static function to calculate the maximum value on an array of integers. This function must have the following signature:
  ```java
  static int findMax(int[] numbers)
  ```
- Create a zip file of your project and drop it on the area above these instructions.
  In a few seconds, Drop Project will give you a report with some metrics about your project.
- If you don't feel like coding this stuff, you can grab a pre-built submission
